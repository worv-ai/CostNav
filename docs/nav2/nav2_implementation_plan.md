## Localization: Ground Truth Odometry

### Overview

CostNav's Nav2 integration uses **ground truth odometry** from Isaac Sim instead of AMCL (Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization) for robot localization. This design choice provides several advantages for simulation-based evaluation and benchmarking.

### Configuration

The navigation parameters are configured to use odometry directly:

```yaml
# AMCL disabled: use odometry (/chassis/odom) as ground-truth localization.
# Nav2 is configured to use `odom` as the global frame, so no AMCL-provided
# `map -> odom` transform is required.

bt_navigator:
  ros__parameters:
    global_frame: map
    robot_base_frame: base_link
    odom_topic: /chassis/odom

controller_server:
  ros__parameters:
    odom_topic: /chassis/odom

local_costmap:
  local_costmap:
    ros__parameters:
      global_frame: odom # Use odom as global frame
      robot_base_frame: base_link

global_costmap:
  global_costmap:
    ros__parameters:
      global_frame: map
      robot_base_frame: base_link
```

### TF Tree Structure

```
map
 └─ odom (from Isaac Sim ground truth)
     └─ base_link
         └─ [sensor frames]
```

The `map -> odom` transform is provided directly by Isaac Sim's ground truth pose, eliminating the need for AMCL's `map -> odom` transform estimation.

### Future Work

For real-world deployment, AMCL or other localization methods (e.g., SLAM) would be required. The current configuration can be easily extended by:

1. Enabling AMCL in the navigation parameters
2. Configuring AMCL to subscribe to `/scan` or `/lidar` topics
3. Setting `global_frame: map` in local_costmap
4. Tuning AMCL parameters for the specific robot and environment

## Performance Optimization: High-Speed Navigation

### Overview

The Segway E1 navigation parameters have been optimized for **high-speed navigation** (2.0 m/s average speed) with **fast human avoidance** capabilities. These optimizations balance speed, safety, and responsiveness for delivery robot operations in dynamic environments.

### Speed Optimization (2.0 m/s Target)

#### Velocity Limits

```yaml
controller_server:
  ros__parameters:
    FollowPath:
      plugin: "dwb_core::DWBLocalPlanner"
      max_vel_x: 3.0 # Maximum forward velocity (increased from 2.0)
      max_speed_xy: 3.0 # Maximum translational speed (increased from 2.0)
      sim_time: 1.0 # Trajectory simulation time (reduced from 2.0s)
      acc_lim_x: 4.0 # Acceleration limit (increased from 2.5)
      decel_lim_x: -4.0 # Deceleration limit (increased from -2.5)
```

**Rationale:**

- `max_vel_x: 3.0` sets the maximum forward speed (target: 2.0 m/s average)
- `sim_time: 1.0` reduced to prevent path deviation penalties at high speeds
- `acc_lim_x: 4.0` allows reaching 3.0 m/s within 1.0s simulation time
- Shorter simulation time + higher acceleration = faster navigation without excessive path deviation

#### Critical Insight: Acceleration Limits and Trajectory Scoring

**The Problem:**
DWB samples velocities up to `max_vel_x`, but **rejects trajectories that violate acceleration limits**. With the original settings:

- `sim_time: 2.0` seconds
- `acc_lim_x: 2.5` m/s²
- Maximum reachable velocity = `2.5 × 2.0 = 5.0 m/s` ✅

However, **faster trajectories travel farther** in simulation time, causing them to deviate more from the path and get heavily penalized by path-following critics (PathAlign, PathDist, GoalAlign, GoalDist).

**Example:**

- 3.0 m/s trajectory with `sim_time: 2.0` → travels 6 meters → high path deviation → rejected
- 1.0 m/s trajectory with `sim_time: 2.0` → travels 2 meters → low path deviation → selected

**The Solution:**

1. **Reduce `sim_time` from 2.0s to 1.0s** - Shorter lookahead reduces path deviation penalty
2. **Increase `acc_lim_x` from 2.5 to 4.0** - Ensures robot can reach max velocity within sim_time
   - Maximum reachable velocity = `4.0 × 1.0 = 4.0 m/s` ✅ (exceeds `max_vel_x: 3.0`)
3. **Reduce path-following critic scales by 50%** - Further reduces penalty for path deviation

#### Trajectory Critic Tuning

```yaml
critics:
  [
    "RotateToGoal",
    "Oscillation",
    "BaseObstacle",
    "GoalAlign",
    "PathAlign",
    "PathDist",
    "GoalDist",
  ]

# Path-following critics (reduced by 50% to allow higher speeds)
PathAlign.scale: 16.0 # Reduced from 32.0
GoalAlign.scale: 12.0 # Reduced from 24.0
PathDist.scale: 16.0 # Reduced from 32.0
GoalDist.scale: 12.0 # Reduced from 24.0

# Obstacle avoidance (unchanged - safety priority)
BaseObstacle.scale: 0.05

# Goal rotation behavior (unchanged)
RotateToGoal.scale: 32.0
RotateToGoal.slowing_factor: 5.0
```

**How DWB Trajectory Scoring Works:**

DWB selects the trajectory with the **lowest total score**:

```
total_score = Σ (critic_raw_score × critic_scale)
```

**Benefits of Reduced Critic Scales:**

- Faster trajectories (2.0-3.0 m/s) are no longer heavily penalized for path deviation
- Robot maintains higher average speeds during navigation
- Still follows the global path (just with more tolerance)
- Obstacle avoidance remains unchanged (safety priority)

### Responsive Costmap Updates

#### Local Costmap Frequency

```yaml
local_costmap:
  local_costmap:
    ros__parameters:
      update_frequency: 10.0 # Increased from 5.0 Hz (2x faster)
      publish_frequency: 5.0 # Increased from 2.0 Hz (2.5x faster)
```

**Benefits:**

- Obstacles detected and incorporated into costmap **twice as fast**
- More up-to-date information for the controller at high speeds
- Better responsiveness to dynamic obstacles (humans, other robots)

#### Controller Frequency

```yaml
controller_server:
  ros__parameters:
    controller_frequency: 30.0 # Increased from 20.0 Hz (50% faster)
    costmap_update_timeout: 0.15 # Reduced from 0.30s (faster processing)
```

**Benefits:**

- Robot reacts **50% faster** to obstacles and path changes
- Smoother trajectory execution at high speeds
- Reduced latency between perception and action

### Fast Human Avoidance

#### Front Lidar Optimization (2D Layer)

```yaml
front_2d_lidar_layer:
  plugin: "nav2_costmap_2d::ObstacleLayer"
  enabled: True
  observation_sources: front_2d_lidar
  front_2d_lidar:
    topic: /front_2d_lidar/scan
    max_obstacle_height: 2.0 # Increased from 1.5m (full human height)
    clearing_range: 5.0 # Increased from 3.0m (67% farther detection)
    obstacle_range: 5.0 # Increased from 3.0m
    raytrace_max_range: 6.0 # Increased from 4.0m
    raytrace_min_range: 0.0
    expected_update_rate: 0.1 # Monitor for 10 Hz updates
```

**Benefits:**

- Detects humans **67% farther** (5m vs 3m)
- Covers full human height (2.0m)
- Faster clearing of space as humans move away

#### Front Lidar Optimization (3D Layer)

```yaml
front_3d_lidar_layer:
  plugin: "nav2_costmap_2d::VoxelLayer"
  enabled: True
  publish_voxel_map: True
  origin_z: 0.0
  z_resolution: 0.2
  z_voxels: 16
  max_obstacle_height: 2.0 # Increased from 1.5m
  mark_threshold: 0
  observation_sources: front_3d_lidar
  front_3d_lidar:
    topic: /front_3d_lidar/point_cloud
    max_obstacle_height: 2.0 # Full human height
    min_obstacle_height: 0.0
    obstacle_max_range: 5.0 # Increased from 3.0m
    obstacle_min_range: 0.0
    raytrace_max_range: 6.0 # Increased from 4.0m
    raytrace_min_range: 0.0
    clearing: True
    marking: True
    voxel_decay: 2.0 # Reduced from 15.0s (7.5x faster decay)
    decay_model: 0 # Linear decay
```

**Benefits:**

- 3D obstacle detection up to **5 meters** ahead
- **7.5x faster voxel decay** (2s vs 15s) for dynamic obstacles
- Quickly clears space as humans move, preventing "ghost obstacles"
- Full 3D coverage of human body (0.0m to 2.0m height)

#### Inflation Layer

```yaml
inflation_layer:
  plugin: "nav2_costmap_2d::InflationLayer"
  cost_scaling_factor: 5.0 # Increased from 3.0 (stronger gradient)
  inflation_radius: 1.2 # Increased from 0.8m (50% larger buffer)
```

**Benefits:**

- **1.2m safety buffer** around humans (was 0.8m)
- Stronger cost gradient encourages earlier avoidance maneuvers
- Safer navigation at 2.0 m/s speeds

#### Obstacle Avoidance Critic

```yaml
BaseObstacle.scale: 0.05 # Increased from 0.02 (2.5x stronger)
```

**Benefits:**

- **2.5x stronger penalty** for trajectories near obstacles
- Robot avoids humans more aggressively
- Maintains safe distances even at high speeds

#### Collision Monitor

```yaml
collision_monitor:
  ros__parameters:
    transform_tolerance: 0.1 # Reduced from 0.2s
    source_timeout: 0.5 # Reduced from 1.0s
    polygons: ["FootprintApproach"]
    FootprintApproach:
      type: "polygon"
      action_type: "approach"
      footprint_topic: "/local_costmap/published_footprint"
      time_before_collision: 1.5 # Increased from 1.2s (earlier prediction)
      simulation_time_step: 0.05 # Reduced from 0.1s (finer simulation)
      min_points: 6
      visualize: True
      enabled: True
```

**Benefits:**

- Predicts collisions **1.5 seconds** ahead (was 1.2s)
- **2x finer simulation** (0.05s vs 0.1s) for more accurate predictions
- Earlier warnings allow smoother avoidance maneuvers

### Planner Optimization

```yaml
planner_server:
  ros__parameters:
    expected_planner_frequency: 5.0 # Reduced from 10.0 Hz
    costmap_update_timeout: 0.5 # Added for faster costmap handling
```

**Rationale:**

- Reduced planner frequency prevents "missed rate" warnings
- Controller runs at 30 Hz, planner at 5 Hz is sufficient
- Allows more CPU resources for high-frequency controller

| Metric                          | Before   | After    | Improvement         |
| ------------------------------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------- |
| **Max Velocity**                | 2.0 m/s  | 3.0 m/s  | +50%                |

| **Safety Buffer**               | 0.8m     | 1.2m     | +50%                |
| **Voxel Decay Time**            | 15s      | 2s       | -87% (7.5x faster)  |
| **Collision Prediction**        | 1.2s     | 1.5s     | +25%                |
| **Obstacle Avoidance Strength** | 0.02     | 0.05     | +150%               |

### Expected Behavior

With these optimizations, the Segway E1 should:

- ✅ Maintain average speeds closer to **2.0 m/s** during navigation (up from ~0.95 m/s)
- ✅ Reach maximum velocity of **3.0 m/s** on straight paths
- ✅ Accelerate **60% faster** with 4.0 m/s² acceleration limit
- ✅ React **50% faster** with 1.0s trajectory simulation time (down from 2.0s)
- ✅ Follow paths with **50% less penalty** for minor deviations (critic scales reduced)
- ✅ Detect humans up to **5 meters** ahead
- ✅ React **50% faster** to obstacles with 30 Hz controller
- ✅ Maintain a **1.2m safety buffer** around humans
- ✅ Update obstacle information every **100ms** (10 Hz)
- ✅ Avoid humans **2.5x more aggressively** with increased critic scale
- ✅ Predict collisions **1.5 seconds** ahead for early avoidance
- ✅ Clear dynamic obstacles **7.5x faster** with reduced voxel decay

### Key Optimization Insights

**Problem Solved:** The robot was stuck at ~0.95 m/s despite `max_vel_x: 3.0` because:

1. **Acceleration Constraint:** With `acc_lim_x: 2.5` and `sim_time: 1.0`, maximum reachable velocity was only 2.5 m/s
2. **Path Deviation Penalty:** Faster trajectories travel farther (e.g., 3.0 m/s × 2.0s = 6m), causing higher path deviation scores and rejection by DWB

**Solution Applied:**

1. **Increased `acc_lim_x` to 4.0 m/s²** - Robot can now reach 4.0 m/s within 1.0s simulation time (exceeds `max_vel_x: 3.0`)
2. **Reduced `sim_time` to 1.0s** - Faster trajectories travel less distance (3.0 m/s × 1.0s = 3m), reducing path deviation
3. **Halved path critic scales** - PathAlign, GoalAlign, PathDist, GoalDist reduced by 50% to further reduce penalty

**Result:** Robot can now achieve 2.0-3.0 m/s speeds while maintaining safe obstacle avoidance and reasonable path following.

## Parameter Tuning: RotationShimController

### Overview

To resolve the Segway E1 spin-in-place problem and improve navigation performance for both robots, we implemented the **Nav2 RotationShimController** as a wrapper around the DWB local planner. This controller enforces in-place rotation when the robot needs to make large heading corrections before following a path.

### What is RotationShimController?

The RotationShimController is a Nav2 controller plugin that:

1. **Monitors heading error** between the robot's current orientation and the path direction
2. **Triggers in-place rotation** when heading error exceeds a threshold (e.g., 45°)
3. **Hands off to primary controller** (DWB) once the robot is roughly aligned with the path
4. **Enables smooth transitions** between rotation and path-following modes

**Reference:** [Nav2 RotationShimController Documentation](https://docs.nav2.org/configuration/packages/configuring-rotation-shim-controller.html)

### Configuration Strategy

We use **consistent angular velocity limits** across all navigation phases:

| Phase                  | Controller             | Angular Velocity | Purpose                                        |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **In-Place Rotation**  | RotationShimController | 0.5 rad/s        | Controlled heading corrections when stationary |
| **Path Following**     | DWB Controller         | 0.5 rad/s        | Stable turning while moving forward            |
| **Recovery Behaviors** | Behavior Server        | 0.5 rad/s        | Controlled recovery spins                      |

### Parameter Configuration

#### 1. RotationShimController Parameters

```yaml
FollowPath:
  plugin: "nav2_rotation_shim_controller::RotationShimController"
  angular_dist_threshold: 0.785 # 45° in radians - rotate in place if heading error > this
  forward_sampling_distance: 0.5 # meters - distance to look ahead on path
  rotate_to_heading_angular_vel: 0.5 # rad/s - rotation speed during in-place rotation
  max_angular_accel: 3.5 # rad/s² - max angular acceleration
  simulate_ahead_time: 2.0 # seconds - collision checking projection time
  rotate_to_goal_heading: false # Don't rotate to goal heading at the end
  closed_loop: false # Use commanded velocity instead of odometry (prevents premature deceleration)
```

**Note on `closed_loop: false` (Segway E1 only):**

- When `true` (default): Uses robot odometry velocity for acceleration calculations
- When `false`: Uses last commanded velocity for acceleration calculations
- Setting to `false` prevents the controller from decelerating too early when approaching the target heading
- This ensures the robot maintains minimum velocity (0.3 rad/s) during in-place rotation
- Only needed for Segway E1 due to its specific dynamics

#### 2. DWB Controller Parameters (Wrapped by RotationShim)

```yaml
primary_controller: "dwb_core::DWBLocalPlanner"
max_vel_theta: 0.5 # rad/s - Cap angular velocity
min_speed_theta: 0.3 # rad/s - Minimum rotation speed when rotating
```

#### 3. Velocity Smoother Parameters

```yaml
velocity_smoother:
  max_velocity: [2.0, 0.0, 0.5] # [vx, vy, vθ] - Cap angular velocity
  min_velocity: [-2.0, 0.0, -0.5]
```

#### 4. Behavior Server Parameters

```yaml
behavior_server:
  max_rotational_vel: 0.5 # rad/s - Cap angular velocity
  min_rotational_vel: 0.3
  rotational_acc_lim: 3.5
```

### Why This Configuration Works

1. **Controlled In-Place Rotations (0.5 rad/s)**
   - Slower speed prevents position loss during rotation
   - 180° turn takes ~6.3 seconds
   - Only active when heading error > 45° (angular_dist_threshold)
   - Prevents excessive speed that could cause localization drift

2. **Stable Forward Motion (0.5 rad/s)**
   - Consistent angular velocity limit across all navigation phases
   - Prevents excessive oscillation on curved paths
   - Maintains smooth trajectory tracking
   - Reduces wear on motors during normal navigation

3. **Velocity Smoother Compatibility**
   - Set to 0.5 rad/s to match controller limits
   - Ensures consistent velocity caps across the navigation stack
   - Smooths acceleration/deceleration for motor protection

4. **Consistent Recovery Behaviors**
   - Recovery spins use same 0.5 rad/s as in-place rotations
   - Controlled recovery from stuck situations
   - Consistent behavior across navigation modes

5. **Minimum Velocity Enforcement (0.3 rad/s)**
   - Prevents robot from getting stuck with very low angular velocities
   - `closed_loop: false` helps maintain this minimum during deceleration
   - Ensures reliable rotation completion

### Nav2 Component Integration

![Nav2 Architecture](nav2_architecture.png)

**Key Nav2 Components to Integrate:**

1. **BT Navigator** - Behavior tree-based navigation orchestration
2. **Planner Server** - Global path planning (NavFn, Smac, Theta\*)
3. **Controller Server** - Local trajectory control (DWB, RPP, MPPI)
4. **Behavior Server** - Recovery behaviors (spin, backup, wait)
5. **Smoother Server** - Path smoothing for feasibility
6. **Costmap 2D** - Environmental representation with layers

---

## Robot Selection

CostNav supports multiple robots for Nav2 navigation. Use the `SIM_ROBOT` environment variable to select between supported robots.

### Supported Robots

| Robot       | Value         | Status      | Description                                        |
| ----------- | ------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Nova Carter | `nova_carter` | ✅ Complete | NVIDIA's reference platform with full sensor suite |
| Segway E1   | `segway_e1`   | ✅ Complete | Delivery robot for urban navigation                |

### Configuration Structure

Robot-specific configuration files are organized as follows:

```
nav2_params/
├── maps/                          # Shared map files for all robots
│   ├── sidewalk.yaml
│   ├── sidewalk.png
│   └── sidewalk_orthographic.png
├── nova_carter/                   # Nova Carter specific files
│   ├── navigation_params.yaml
│   ├── navigation.rviz
│   └── navigation_teleop.rviz
└── segway_e1/                     # Segway E1 specific files
    ├── navigation_params.yaml
    ├── navigation.rviz
    └── navigation_teleop.rviz
```

### Switching Between Robots

**Option 1: Environment Variable**

```bash
# Use Nova Carter (default)
make run-nav2

# Use Segway E1
SIM_ROBOT=segway_e1 make run-nav2
```

**Option 2: Set in `.env` file**

```bash
# Add to .env file
SIM_ROBOT=segway_e1
```

**Option 3: Docker Compose Override**

```bash
# Use Segway E1
docker compose --profile nav2 up -e SIM_ROBOT=segway_e1
```

The `SIM_ROBOT` variable automatically selects:

- Robot-specific navigation parameters (`/workspace/nav2_params/${SIM_ROBOT}/navigation_params.yaml`)
- Robot-specific RViz configuration (`/workspace/nav2_params/${SIM_ROBOT}/navigation.rviz`)
- Robot-specific teleop RViz configuration (`/workspace/nav2_params/${SIM_ROBOT}/navigation_teleop.rviz`)
- Shared map files (`/workspace/nav2_params/maps/sidewalk.yaml`)

---

## Running Nav2

### Quick Start

**Option 1: Run Stack (Manual Missions)**

```bash
# From repository root, start both containers with Nav2 profile
make run-nav2

# Trigger a mission manually
make start-mission
```

To customize mission parameters, edit `config/mission_config.yaml` or use:

```bash
# Inside Isaac Sim container
python /workspace/costnav_isaacsim/launch.py \
    --mission-timeout 600 \
    --min-distance 10.0 \
    --max-distance 30.0
```

**Option 2: Manual Launch (Step by Step)**

**1. Launch Isaac Sim with Nova Carter:**

```bash
cd /workspace/costnav_isaacsim
python launch.py
```

**2. In Docker Container, Launch Nav2:**

```bash
# Source ROS2 environment
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source /workspace/build_ws/install/local_setup.sh

# Launch Nav2 with Nova Carter
ros2 launch carter_navigation carter_navigation.launch.py \
    map:=/workspace/costnav_isaacsim/nav2_params/carter_sidewalk.yaml \
    params_file:=/workspace/costnav_isaacsim/nav2_params/carter_navigation_params.yaml
```

**3. Mission Orchestration (Manual Trigger):**

Missions are triggered manually via `/start_mission`:

```bash
# Trigger a mission via Makefile
make start-mission

# Or call the service directly
ros2 service call /start_mission std_srvs/srv/Trigger {}
```

**Configuration Files:**

- **Map:** `/workspace/costnav_isaacsim/nav2_params/carter_sidewalk.yaml`
- **Parameters:** `/workspace/costnav_isaacsim/nav2_params/carter_navigation_params.yaml`
- **Map Image:** `/workspace/costnav_isaacsim/nav2_params/carter_sidewalk.png`
- **Mission Module:** `/workspace/costnav_isaacsim/nav2_mission/`

### Docker Volume Mounting

Ensure the following volumes are mounted in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
volumes:
  - /workspace/costnav_isaacsim/nav2_params:/workspace/costnav_isaacsim/nav2_params:ro
```

- `MarkerPublisher` ROS2 node publishing to:
  - `/start_marker` - Green arrow for start position
  - `/goal_marker` - Red arrow for goal position
  - `/robot_marker` - Blue arrow for current robot position (real-time from `/odom`)
- Uses `visualization_msgs/Marker` with ARROW type
- TRANSIENT_LOCAL QoS for persistent marker visibility

**3. Mission Orchestrator (`mission_orchestrator.py`)**

- `MissionOrchestrator` ROS2 node that coordinates:
  - NavMesh-based position sampling
  - Robot teleportation via Isaac Sim API
  - Initial pose publication to `/initialpose`
  - Goal pose publication to `/goal_pose`
  - RViz marker updates
- `MissionConfig` dataclass for configuration

- Manages mission lifecycle alongside simulation loop
- Graceful stop/cleanup with `_stop_event`
- Interruptible sleep between missions

**5. Configuration (`config/`)**

Mission parameters are configured via YAML file at `config/mission_config.yaml`:

```yaml
mission:
  timeout: 3600.0 # Mission timeout (seconds)

distance:
  min: 5.0 # Minimum start-goal distance (meters)
  max: 50.0 # Maximum start-goal distance (meters)

nav2:
  wait_time: 10.0 # Wait for Nav2 stack to initialize

teleport:
  robot_prim: "/World/Nova_Carter_ROS"
  height_offset: 0.5

markers:
  enabled: true
  topics:
    start: "/start_marker"
    goal: "/goal_marker"
    robot: "/robot_marker"
```

**6. Integrated Launch (`launch.py`)**

The mission module loads config at startup with CLI overrides:

```bash
# Use default config (config/mission_config.yaml)
python launch.py

# Use custom config file
python launch.py --config /path/to/custom.yaml

# Override config values via CLI
python launch.py --mission-timeout 600 --min-distance 10

# Available CLI overrides:
#   --config PATH       Path to config YAML file
#   --mission-timeout S Override: Mission timeout
#   --min-distance M    Override: Minimum start-goal distance
#   --max-distance M    Override: Maximum start-goal distance
#   --nav2-wait S       Override: Nav2 wait time
```

**Implementation:**

**Isaac Sim Container:**

- Enable `omni.isaac.ros2_bridge` extension
- Configure ROS2 bridge to publish on Docker network
- Use Action Graphs for sensor data publishing
- Implement velocity command subscriber
- Set ROS_DOMAIN_ID environment variable
- Configure DDS discovery for cross-container communication

**Nav2 Container:**

- Source ROS2 environment on startup
- Launch Nav2 stack with proper parameters
- Run RViz2 for visualization
- Use same ROS_DOMAIN_ID as Isaac Sim
- Configure DDS middleware (CycloneDDS recommended)

### 2. Cost Model Integration

Track Nav2 navigation metrics for comparison with RL baseline:

```python
# nav2_cost_tracker.py - Subscribe to Nav2 topics and compute costs
nav2_metrics = {
    "energy_consumed": float,    # From /cmd_vel
    "time_to_goal": float,       # From action status
    "collision_count": int,      # From costmap
    "sla_compliance": bool,      # From timestamps
}
```

**Integration:** Create `nav2_cost_tracker.py` that subscribes to Nav2 topics and computes CostNav economic metrics.

---

## Testing Strategy

**Basic Testing Approach:**

1. **Unit Tests** - Test ROS2 bridge, costmap, cost tracker
2. **Integration Tests** - End-to-end navigation scenarios
3. **Benchmark Tests** - Compare Nav2 vs RL baseline

**Key Test Scenarios:**

- Basic navigation to goal
- Obstacle avoidance
- Delivery mission completion
- Cost metric validation

**Reference:** Use same test scenarios as RL evaluation for fair comparison.
