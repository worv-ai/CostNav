# ViNT Evaluation Configuration for CostNav
# This config is used by the ViNT agent during inference

# Model architecture parameters
context_size: 5                    # Number of past frames for temporal context
len_traj_pred: 5                   # Number of waypoints to predict
learn_angle: true                  # Predict heading angles
obs_encoder: "efficientnet-b0"     # Image encoder backbone
obs_encoding_size: 512             # Encoding dimension
late_fusion: false                 # Early fusion of obs+goal
mha_num_attention_heads: 4         # Transformer attention heads
mha_num_attention_layers: 4        # Transformer layers
mha_ff_dim_factor: 4               # Feedforward dimension factor

# Input dimensions
image_size: [85, 64]               # [width, height] - matches training

# Action normalization
# WARNING: waypoint_spacing and metric_waypoint_spacing are training-time constants.
# They MUST exactly match the values in the training config (vint_costnav.yaml).
# Changing them here without retraining will silently break waypoint scale.
# See: training normalization  →  actions[:, :2] /= metric_waypoint_spacing * waypoint_spacing
#      eval denormalization    →  waypoints[:, :, :2] *= metric_waypoint_spacing * waypoint_spacing
normalize: true                    # Denormalize predicted waypoints to metric coordinates
waypoint_spacing: 1                # Subsampling stride over trajectory frames (training-time constant)
metric_waypoint_spacing: 0.25      # Physical distance between consecutive frames in meters (training-time constant)
