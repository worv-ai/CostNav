# Robot Configuration for Nova Carter in Isaac Sim
# Used by IL baseline agents for velocity limits and timing

# Velocity limits
max_v: 0.8        # Maximum linear velocity (m/s) - matches ViNT training config
max_w: 0.8        # Maximum angular velocity (rad/s) - matches ViNT training config

# Timing
# IMPORTANT: frame_rate is used for waypoint normalization (MAX_V / RATE)
# This must match the training config (3 Hz), NOT the inference rate
frame_rate: 3     # Training frame rate (Hz) - used for waypoint scaling

# Topic names (for reference - actual topics used in ROS2 node)
# These are not directly used by the agent but documented for reference
topics:
  cmd_vel: /cmd_vel              # Main velocity command topic
  cmd_vel_model: /cmd_vel_model  # Model output velocity topic
  odom: /chassis/odom                    # Odometry topic
  image: /front_stereo_camera/left/image_raw  # Camera image topic
