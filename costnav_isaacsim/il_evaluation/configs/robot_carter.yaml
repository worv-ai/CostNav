# Robot Configuration for Nova Carter in Isaac Sim
# Used by trajectory follower for odometry topic.
# Velocity limits are NOT needed here — waypoint denormalization uses model
# config (metric_waypoint_spacing * waypoint_spacing) and max velocities are
# trajectory follower CLI arguments (--max_linear_vel, --max_angular_vel).

# Topic names (for reference - actual topics used in ROS2 node)
# These are not directly used by the agent but documented for reference
topics:
  cmd_vel: /cmd_vel              # Main velocity command topic
  cmd_vel_model: /cmd_vel_model  # Model output velocity topic
  odom: /chassis/odom                    # Odometry topic
  image: /front_stereo_camera/left/image_raw  # Camera image topic
