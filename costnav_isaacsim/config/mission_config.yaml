# Nav2 Mission Configuration for CostNav
# This file configures the automated mission orchestration system.
#
# Usage:
#   python launch.py --mission                    # Uses this default config
#   python launch.py --mission --config custom.yaml  # Uses custom config

# Mission execution settings
mission:

  # Mission timeout (seconds)
  timeout: null  # No timeout (use a float number like 3600.0 for 1 hour)

# Distance constraints for start/goal sampling (in meters)
distance:
  # Minimum distance between start and goal positions
  min: 20.0

  # Maximum distance between start and goal positions
  max: 250.0

# Nav2 integration settings
nav2:
  # Time to wait for Nav2 stack to initialize (seconds)
  wait_time: 10.0

  # Delay after setting initial pose before publishing goal (seconds)
  initial_pose_delay: 2.0

  # Topic names for Nav2 communication
  topics:
    initial_pose: "/initialpose"
    goal_pose: "/goal_pose"
    odom: "/chassis/odom"

# Robot teleportation settings
teleport:
  # Height offset when teleporting robot (meters)
  height_offset: 0.5

  # Robot prim path in USD stage (chassis_link prim for direct teleportation)
