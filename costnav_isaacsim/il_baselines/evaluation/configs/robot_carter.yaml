# Robot Configuration for Nova Carter in Isaac Sim
# Used by IL baseline agents for velocity limits and timing

# Velocity limits
max_v: 1.0        # Maximum linear velocity (m/s)
max_w: 1.0        # Maximum angular velocity (rad/s)

# Timing
frame_rate: 10    # Observation rate (Hz) - matches inference rate

# Topic names (for reference - actual topics used in ROS2 node)
# These are not directly used by the agent but documented for reference
topics:
  cmd_vel: /cmd_vel              # Main velocity command topic
  cmd_vel_model: /cmd_vel_model  # Model output velocity topic
  odom: /odom                    # Odometry topic
  image: /front_stereo_camera/left/image_raw  # Camera image topic
